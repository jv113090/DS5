# Justin Vena's Project question and dataset

**1. What is the question you hope to answer?*

Can we predict what characteristics (mainly based on income and ZIP codes) to which areas will buy an ACA dental insurance product?

**2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?*

Kaggle.com's public data on the Health Insurance Marketplace. Will also use Census.gov's data set to bring in income related information.

**3. What do you know about the data so far?*

Kaggle's  data set contains information about the different plans and rates sold to individuals and to small businesses. Also contains information about location (State, County, ZIP). It does not include all states, but the project will most likely not include all states. May focus on a few or one state. Will also use Census.gov's datasets to bring in income related information.

**4. Why did you choose this topic? **

I have always worked in the employee benefits realm. This would continue to in the area that I am familiar, and it also would provide insights on the type of people that are purchasing ACA exchange plans.
